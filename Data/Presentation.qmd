## Expected Goals using Spatial Bins

An interactive Shiny app  
based on Bundesliga shot data of the last 2 seasons

## What is this project about?

The goal of this project was to build a simple and interactive way  
to estimate shot quality in soccer.

Instead of using a complex machine learning model,  
I focused on a spatial approach:

- where shots are taken from
- how often shots from that area result in goals

## Data

- Source: StatsBomb Open Data
- Competition: 1. Bundesliga
- Data type: event data
- I only used shots

For each shot, I kept:

- the x and y location
- whether the shot resulted in a goal

## Basic idea

The pitch is divided into equally sized spatial bins.

For each bin, I calculate:

average goal probability =  
number of goals / number of shots

This gives an empirical estimate of how likely a shot  
from that area is to result in a goal.

## Shiny App

I built a Shiny app to visualize this idea.

The app shows:

- a heatmap of the pitch
- each bin colored by its average goal probability

Users can click on any bin to see:

- how many shots were taken there
- the average goal probability for that area

## Important note

Some bins contain very few shots.

In those cases:

- the average can be very high or very low
- this can create extreme values far away from the goal

This is not a coding error.
It is a data limitation caused by small sample sizes.

## Why this approach?

This method is:

- easy to understand
- easy to explain
- visually intuitive

It clearly shows:

- where goals usually come from
- and where estimates become unreliable due to limited data

## Conclusion

In this project, I built:

- a spatial expected goals visualization
- based on real Bundesliga data
- implemented as an interactive Shiny app

The project shows both:

- useful patterns in shot quality
- and the limitations of raw empirical estimates
