## What is Expected Goals?

Expected goals (xG) is a statistic used in football\
to measure the quality of a shot.

Each shot has a probability of resulting in a goal,\
based on previous shots from similar positions.

The idea of this project was to build a simple tool\
to estimate xG

## Data

-   Source: StatsBomb Open Data
-   Competition: 1. Bundesliga
-   Data type: event data
-   I only used shots

For each shot, I kept:

-   the x and y location
-   whether the shot resulted in a goal

## Data Collection

Getting the data was the hardest part of the project.

Steps: \
- Load all competitions\
- Select Bundesliga seasons using competition and season IDs\
- Load all matches from those seasons - Load all events from the matches\
- Filter the data so only shots remain\

## Method

I first created a football pitch and then divided into equally sized spatial bins.

For each bin: \
- all shots inside the bin are collected\
- the average goal probability is calculated\
average goal probability =\
number of goals / number of shots

This gives an xG value for each area of the pitch.

## Example

## Limitations

Some bins contain very few shots.

If only one shot was taken from a bin and it resulted in a goal, the average xG can become unrealistically high.

This is not a coding error, but a limitation caused by small sample sizes.

## Conclusion

In this project I built:

-   a expected goals visualization
-   based on real Bundesliga data
-   implemented it in interactive Shiny app
